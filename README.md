# Professional Portfolio Site | timzander.com
## About
This website showcases my professional story, featured works, and contact information as well as my
personal style of bold, minimalistic, clean and elegant design.  The site is created using Python with
Flask, Javascript, KnockoutJS, HTML and CSS and uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) data structure.
Any changes to the view are updated asynchronously using Knockout observables for an incredibly responsive 
and smooth experience.
